# Getting Sticky
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Add structure to a web page from the DOM point of view. Build a page where the user can create a series of notes to the page, edit the content, and delete the notes. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## MVP

When a user visits the site...
   
    - they should see text called "Total number of notes:", initially this should be set to zero 
    - there should be a button that says "Add A NOTE"

When a user clicks on the "Add A Note" button 
    
     - a new editable note appended to the page
     - the total note counter needs to be updated


### Feature Requests

- Create a button, which when clicked lets the user add a note
- Create a counter that keeps track of number of notes
- The user likes adding notes, but from time to time they want to come back and edit these notes. Make these notes editable, maybe what you need is content editable attribute!!!!
- User needs to delete some notes, when they become outdated. Add a "X" on the notes so they can be disposed when the "X" is clicked

### Bonus
- Add a datetime stamp for the note, when it is created, this needs to be updated everytime the note is updated
